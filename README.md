# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis using SQL

## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, I performed end-to-end data analysis on a simulated retail sales dataset using MySQL. The objective was to clean, explore, and analyze transactional data to extract valuable business insights, supporting data-driven decision-making for a retail strategy. This project applies essential SQL skills needed for real-world data analysis, demonstrating my readiness for data analyst positions.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Set up a retail sales database from raw transactional data
- Perform data profiling, including null value detection, duplicate checks, and schema validation
- Clean and transform data to ensure consistency and reliability
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) entirely in SQL
- Answer realistic business questions around product sales, customer segments, and seasonal trends
- Write optimized, reusable SQL queries for future reporting and analysis
- Document each data-cleaning and analysis step for clear reproducibility

  ## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **MySQL Workbench** (SQL IDE for writing and testing queries)  
- **MySQL Server** (database engine to store and process the data)  
- **GitHub** (version control and portfolio showcase)
