# üìä Retail Sales Analysis using SQL

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, I performed end-to-end data analysis on a simulated retail sales dataset using MySQL. The objective was to clean, explore, and analyze transactional data to extract valuable business insights, supporting data-driven decision-making for a retail strategy. This project applies essential SQL skills needed for real-world data analysis, demonstrating my readiness for data analyst positions.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Set up a retail sales database from raw transactional data
- Perform data profiling, including null value detection, duplicate checks, and schema validation
- Clean and transform data to ensure consistency and reliability
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) entirely in SQL
- Answer realistic business questions about product sales, customer segments, and seasonal trends
- Write optimized, reusable SQL queries for future reporting and analysis
- Document each data-cleaning and analysis step for clear reproducibility

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **MySQL Workbench** (SQL IDE for writing and testing queries)  
- **MySQL Server** (database engine to store and process the data)  
- **GitHub** (version control and portfolio showcase)
  
## üóÇÔ∏è Data Preparation & Cleaning

- Renamed columns for clarity  
- Checked for and removed any NULL values  
- Verified that `transactions_id` has no duplicates  
- Sorted the dataset by `sale_time` in ascending order  
- Exported the clean dataset to CSV for reproducibility

## üîé Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA tasks performed with supporting queries:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Check the total number of records in the dataset**  

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Rename table and columns for consistency **
ALTER TABLE retail_matrix.retail_sales RENAME TO retail_sales;
ALTER TABLE retail_sales RENAME COLUMN quantiy TO quantity;

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Check for NULL values across key columns**
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category IS NULL
  OR gender IS NULL
  OR customer_id IS NULL
  OR quantity IS NULL
  OR age IS NULL
  OR price_per_unit IS NULL
  OR cogs IS NULL
  OR total_sale IS NULL;

**4Ô∏è‚É£ . Check for duplicate transaction IDs **
SELECT transaction_id, COUNT(*)
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY transaction_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

**5Ô∏è‚É£ . Sort the data by sale date in ascending order**
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
ORDER BY sale_date ASC;

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Preview the first 5 rows of the cleaned table**
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
LIMIT 5;
